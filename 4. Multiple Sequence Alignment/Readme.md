# Multiple Sequence Alignment

Goals:

- Align multiple sequences

-  Build HMM for multiple alignment

Getting sequences:

These 10 proteins from TRYPSIN family are given as training and test sequences, respectively: Train PDB IDs: 1H4W, 1AVW, 1BZX, 1V2O, 2RA3, 3I29, 4WWY, 1ANE

Test PDB IDs: 1OS8, 1PQA

Obtain these sequences in FASTA format and use them in the next parts.

**Part A:**

I. In order to get first goal, you are supposed to use Matlab toolbox to align multiple sequences. (you should study the document of Matlab toolbox completely and set the parameters properly)

II. Visualize results.

**Part B:**

For the second goal you are asked to implement your own code to build HMM for multiple alignment, according to part A result. Then use it to align the test sequences.
