# Multiple Sequence Alignment

Goals:

- Align multiple sequences

-  Build HMM for multiple alignment

Getting sequences:

These 10 proteins from TRYPSIN family are given as training and test sequences, respectively: 

Train PDB IDs: 1H4W, 1AVW, 1BZX, 1V2O, 2RA3, 3I29, 4WWY, 1ANE

Test PDB IDs: 1OS8, 1PQA

Obtain these sequences in FASTA format and use them in the next parts.

**Part A:**

I. In order to get first goal, we are supposed to use Matlab toolbox to align multiple sequences.

II. Visualize results.

**Part B:**

For the second goal we implement own code to build HMM for multiple alignment, according to part A result. Then use it to align the test sequences.
