# Clustering for Microarray

A DNA microarray is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains Pico moles (10âˆ’12 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as probes (or reporters or oligos). These can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a cDNA or 
cRNA sample (called target) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of fluorophore-, silver-, or chemiluminescencelabeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target. Our tasks here are:

1. Apply the common clustering methods and select the suitable one for your specific microarray data.

2. Apply the clustering algorithm on the dataset while choosing the parameters properly for your clustering method (for example set suitable k in k_means clustering).

3. Analyze your clustering results with clustering evaluation metrics.

4. Apply an effective sample selection (i.e., feature selection) method to select 2 top samples in order to visualize your clustering results.

5. It contains as well:

- The reason of selecting the clustering method according to your dataset
- Parameter settings
- Results
- Plot of clusters
